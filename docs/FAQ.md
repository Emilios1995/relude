# Frequently asked questions

Or at least questions we imagine that people might ask.

## Why don't you just use PureScript?

[PureScript](http://www.purescript.org) has nailed a great many things, but ReasonML/BuckleScript/OCaml has recently swooped in and captured the hearts of many in both the JavaScript and FP communities, with its mix of functional programming capabilities, immutability, speed, pragmatism, and interop potential.  (This is not to say that there wasn't a vibrant OCaml community before, but ReasonML has been effective at exposing it to a whole new audience.)  Overall, we wanted to have a way to write code in the style of PureScript, but with the pragmatic capabilities and speed of ReasonML/OCaml.
