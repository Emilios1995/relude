# Status

## Project Status

Relude has a fairly complete test suite and is being used in production by at least two companies. However, it's still a relatively young project, is subject to breaking changes, and likely has some bugs. Some of the function implementations are not optimized, as we have been more focused on the interfaces rather than the implementations initially. We hope to improve implementations and performance over time.

## Documentation Status

The documentation for Relude is a work in progress.  We have started to document the code with inline documentation comments, but HTML generation for in-code documentation is currently on-hold.  We're waiting to see what shakes out as the preferred documentation extraction/rendering tool for the ReasonML/BuckleScript community.  We are also working on a separate [documentation site](https://reazen.github.io/relude) to act as more of a high-level guide for the modules defined in Relude.
